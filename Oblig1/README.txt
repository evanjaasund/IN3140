What was difficult?

- The most demanding task was Task 3. When I had calculate the values of the point referred to as “g” I did a lot of minor mistakes as there was a lot of cos, sin and thetas to keep in place. The matrix multiplication from A_0_3 was also a bit difficult.



What was easy?

- After I found the cosine-sentence the inverse kinematics from Task 4 became quite straight forward.



Could I have done anything better?

- My sketches/drawing aren’t that good and I feel like I could have putted some more time into it.
